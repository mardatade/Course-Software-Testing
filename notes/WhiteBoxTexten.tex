\framesubtitle{C0: Statement coverage}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Is a program sufficiently tested when each statement has been executed at least once?
  \item How to determine a minimum test quantity? 
  \item Is it useful to cover even empty statements (e.g. missing \texttt{else})? 
  \item The structure of the program is not taken into account 
  \item Basically:\\
        Coverage is not decisive!

Precondition is the construction of a control flow graph for an (imperative) program:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Every single statement, which does not contain any further statements, is represented as a node.
  \item Conditional statements are represented as branches.
  \item Loops are represented as cycles and 
  \item Sequences by edges between nodes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Behind this software metric by McCabe is the idea that above a certain complexity a module is no longer comprehensible to humans. 
  \item The cyclomatic complexity is defined as the number of independent paths on the control flow graph of a module.
  \item The cyclomatic complexity indicates how many test cases are needed to achieve Edge-coverage.
  \item The complexity measure according to McCabe is equal to the number of binary branches plus 1.
  \item According to McCabe, the cyclomatic number of a self-contained subprogram should not exceed 10, otherwise the program is too complex and too difficult to test.

\frametitle{Notes on the Edge-coverage criterion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is enforced, that every condition is passed with true and false.
  \item The edge coverage criterion is thus \emph{stronger} than the statement coverage criterion.
  \item Occasionally however not strong enough:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Compound conditions are not sufficiently considered.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Insufficient for testing loops
\end{itemize}

  \item The test set \{(x=0, z=1), (x=1, z=3)\} meets the Edge-coverage criterion, but does not recognize the division by 0.
  \item Dependencies remain undetected!

\begin{itemize}
  \item Die Testmenge\\
   \{(x=0, z=1), (x=1, z=3), (x=0, z=3), (x=1, z=1)\}\\
   meets the Path-coverage criterion.
  \item Problem: The number of paths grows exponentially with the length of the program code, so testing with the Path-coverage criterion is unrealistic.
  \item Another problem: Number of paths for loops..\\
  Solution: Heuristics.\\
   Example heuristics for the number of loop cycles:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 0 times
      \item \emph{moderately } often 
      \item maximum count
    \end{itemize}
  Boundary values are important!

Here e.g.\\
%\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{quote}
\texttt\sffamily{if (C1 and C2) ST;\\
~~else SF;}
\end{quote}
is transformed into the following statement:\\
\begin{quote}
\texttt\sffamily{if (C1)\\
~~if (C2) ST\\
~~else SF\\
else SF}
\end{quote}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The new control flow graph covers all basic (sub)conditions and thus makes \emph{hidden} edges visible.
  \item The condition coverage criterion may therefore result in even stronger test sets.
\end{itemize}
