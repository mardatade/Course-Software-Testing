\begin{block}{How much testing is enough?}
\begin{enumerate}[align=parleft]
\item [\small Exhaustive test:] Test approach in which the test suite comprises all combinations of input values and preconditions.
\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Not feasible} except for trivial cases
\end{itemize}
\item [\small Risk mitigation:] Use risks and \alert{priorities to focus} testing efforts.
\begin{itemize}
\item Impossible to understand all end user scenarios
\item Impossible to analyze all implications of code changes
\item [\small Automation:] Automated testing can have significant coverage
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Equivalence Class Partitioning}
\begin{block}{Aim}
\alert{Divide} input \alert{parameter} and output  ranges into equivalence classes.
%Divide the definition ranges of input parameters and value ranges of output parameters into equivalence classes from which test cases can be derived.
\end{block}
 
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{block}{Assumption}
When processing a representative from an equivalence class, a program \alert{behaves the same way as with all other values} from this equivalence class.
\end{block}
 
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{block}{Representative value for a test case}
Any representative value from each class.
\end{block}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Boundary Value Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Test cases that cover the boundary values of equivalence classes or that are in the \alert{immediate vicinity of the boundaries} uncover errors very often.
  \item \alert{Not any element} from the equivalence class is valid as representative for all boundaries.
  \item Pick one or more \alert{elements such that every boundary} of the equivalence class is tested.
\end{itemize}
